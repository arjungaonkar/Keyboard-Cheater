# Keyboard-Cheater
Saw a flaw in campus recruitment coding round and built a program around it.
* Run this program in background.
* Click **Alt+R** to start and **Alt+P** to stop monitoring the keyboard.
* **Alt+S** to send the monitoried data,data is sent by boardcasting to every pc on local network.
* Recieved data is added to list.
* **Alt+L** to get the count of list.
* **Alt+num** will index the list and send the data to keyboardbuffer(types the data).
